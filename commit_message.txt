Ramin Yazdani | PCA and Missing Data Imputation | main | WIP(data): Add mass spectrometry dataset with missing values

Add the mass spectrometry toy dataset which contains missing values marked as 
"NA". This dataset will be used to demonstrate and compare various missing data 
imputation strategies.

Contents added:
- data/ms_toy.txt (mass spectrometry dataset with missing values)

Dataset characteristics:
- Contains missing values marked as "NA"
- Tab-separated format
- Suitable size for imputation algorithm development
- Realistic biological data structure

Purpose:
- Demonstrate distribution-based imputation methods
- Test k-Nearest Neighbor imputation
- Compare imputation strategy performance
- Evaluate imputation quality metrics

Verified:
- File is properly formatted with consistent NA markers
- Dataset has sufficient missing values for testing
