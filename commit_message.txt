Ramin Yazdani | PCA and Missing Data Imputation | main | WIP(imputation): Add kNN vs distribution method comparison

Enhance the kNN notebook with detailed comparison against distribution-based 
methods. This provides quantitative evidence for when kNN performs better than 
simpler approaches.

Enhancements added:
- Comprehensive comparison section between kNN and distribution methods
- Side-by-side metric evaluation (RMSE, MAE)
- Performance analysis across different k values
- Method selection guidance

Comparison features:
- Direct metric comparison (kNN vs. mean/median/distribution)
- Statistical significance testing
- Parameter sensitivity for k values
- Computational complexity analysis

Analysis additions:
- Tabular comparison of all methods
- Best-case scenarios for each method
- Recommendations for method selection
- Discussion of trade-offs

Verified:
- Comparison metrics are accurate and fair
- Statistical tests execute properly
- Analysis provides actionable insights
