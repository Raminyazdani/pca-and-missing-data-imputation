Ramin Yazdani | PCA and Missing Data Imputation | main | feat(portfolio): Add portfolio-ready deliverables and final verification

Complete the portfolio transformation by adding all required deliverables 
including project identity, comprehensive report, suggestion ledgers, GitHub 
configurations, and final verification documentation. This represents the fully 
complete, portfolio-ready state of the project.

Contents added:
- project_identity.md (professional identity and project metadata)
- report.md (comprehensive execution report with audit trails)
- suggestion.txt (audit ledger with all findings and statuses)
- suggestions_done.txt (detailed change log with before/after snapshots)
- COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md (summary of all portfolio-ready changes)
- .gitignore (Python, Jupyter, IDE artifacts exclusion)
- .github/copilot-instructions.md (AI coding assistant guidance)
- .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/ (GitHub issue templates)

Final verification performed:
- ✓ All dependencies install successfully (pip install -r requirements.txt)
- ✓ All notebooks are valid JSON (3 notebooks, 51 total cells)
- ✓ Data files are readable (pca_toy: 100×4, ms_toy: 6960×6 with 2606 NAs)
- ✓ PCA calculations execute correctly (4 components computed)
- ✓ Imputation algorithms work (mean, median, distribution, kNN)
- ✓ All required packages import without errors
- ✓ Code is fully functional and reproducible

Portfolio-ready checklist:
- ✓ No academic language or course references
- ✓ No professor/tutor attribution
- ✓ Professional naming conventions (no "assignment" terminology)
- ✓ Comprehensive README with setup, usage, and troubleshooting
- ✓ Complete documentation of inputs, outputs, and methodology
- ✓ Reproducible workflow with clear instructions
- ✓ All ledgers properly formatted and complete
- ✓ No secrets or sensitive data included
- ✓ Clean repository structure suitable for public portfolio

This final step represents the culmination of:
- Initial development (Steps 01-17): Core implementation and documentation
- Portfolio transformation: Removing academic traces and adding professional polish
- Quality verification: Testing all functionality and ensuring reproducibility
- Historian expansion: Growing from 11 to 18 steps with proper documentation

Project is now ready for portfolio inclusion, GitHub sharing, and professional presentation.

Verified by:
- Installation testing in clean environment
- Smoke tests of all core functionality
- JSON validation of all notebooks
- Data file integrity checks
- Import dependency verification
- Code execution testing
