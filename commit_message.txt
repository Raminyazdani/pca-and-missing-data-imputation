Ramin Yazdani | PCA and Missing Data Imputation | main | WIP(setup): Initial commit: Create README

Start the repository with the essential documentation file. This follows the 
typical pattern of creating the project README first to define the project 
scope and goals before adding any other files.

Contents:
- README.md (basic project description with placeholder sections)
- requirements.txt (empty placeholder file)

Project overview:
- Defines PCA and missing data imputation as main goals
- Lists planned tech stack (Python, NumPy, scikit-learn)
- Provides basic folder structure outline

Verified:
- README provides initial project overview
- File structure is clean and minimal
