Ramin Yazdani | PCA and Missing Data Imputation | main | WIP(imputation): Add distribution-based sampling imputation

Complete the distribution-based imputation notebook by adding probabilistic 
sampling from observed value distributions. This approach better preserves the 
original data distribution compared to mean/median imputation.

Enhancements added:
- Distribution-based imputation using random sampling
- Parameter sensitivity analysis with multiple random seeds
- Comprehensive evaluation metrics across all three methods
- Visualization of imputation quality

Distribution sampling features:
- Samples from empirical distribution of observed values
- Preserves variance and distribution shape
- Includes randomness for realistic imputation
- Parameter sweep for sensitivity analysis

Analysis additions:
- Histograms comparing imputed vs. original distributions
- Parameter sweep visualizations
- CSV output with detailed metrics
- Statistical comparison of all methods

Verified:
- Distribution sampling preserves data characteristics
- Parameter sensitivity appropriately tested
- All three methods (mean, median, distribution) work correctly
