Ramin Yazdani | PCA and Missing Data Imputation | main | WIP(imputation): Implement mean imputation method

Start the missing data imputation notebook with the simplest approach: mean 
imputation. Replace missing values with the column mean, providing a baseline 
for comparison with more sophisticated methods.

Contents added:
- code/missing_data_imputation.ipynb (initial version with mean imputation)

Implementation includes:
- Data loading from ms_toy.txt with NA handling
- Missing value identification
- Column-wise mean calculation (excluding NAs)
- Missing value replacement with means
- Basic quality metrics (RMSE, MAE)

Mean imputation approach:
- Fast and simple computation
- Preserves column means
- Does not preserve variance
- Serves as baseline for comparison

Verified:
- Missing values correctly identified
- Mean calculations exclude NA values
- Imputation executes without errors
