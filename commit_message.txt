Ramin Yazdani | PCA and Missing Data Imputation | main | WIP(imputation): Implement basic k-Nearest Neighbor imputation

Start the kNN imputation notebook with core algorithm implementation. The kNN 
method estimates missing values based on the k most similar samples in the 
feature space, providing a more sophisticated alternative to distribution methods.

Contents added:
- code/knn_imputation.ipynb (kNN implementation - initial version)

Implementation includes:
- k-Nearest Neighbor imputation algorithm
- Distance-based similarity computation using Euclidean distance
- Weighted averaging of k nearest neighbors
- Parameter tuning for optimal k value
- Basic imputation quality metrics

Key algorithm details:
- Finds k most similar samples for each missing value
- Uses Euclidean distance in feature space
- Implements weighted averaging based on distance
- Handles missing values by using only complete features

Verified:
- kNN algorithm executes correctly
- Distance calculations are accurate
- Missing values imputed based on similar samples
