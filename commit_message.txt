Ramin Yazdani | PCA and Missing Data Imputation | main | WIP(imputation): Add median imputation method

Extend the imputation notebook with median imputation as an alternative to mean 
imputation. Median is more robust to outliers and can provide better results 
for skewed distributions.

Enhancements added:
- Median imputation implementation
- Side-by-side comparison with mean imputation
- Evaluation metrics for both methods

Median imputation features:
- Robust to outliers in the data
- Better for non-normal distributions
- Simple and interpretable
- Comparison metrics vs. mean approach

Implementation details:
- Column-wise median calculation
- Missing value replacement
- Quality metric computation
- Comparative analysis added

Verified:
- Median calculations are correct
- Comparison shows differences between methods
- Both methods execute successfully
