Ramin Yazdani | PCA and Missing Data Imputation | main | WIP(setup): Add Python dependencies

Add requirements.txt with the core dependencies needed for the project: NumPy 
for numerical computing, Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib for 
visualization, scikit-learn for ML algorithms, and Jupyter for interactive 
notebooks.

Contents added:
- requirements.txt (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, jupyter)

Dependencies specified:
- numpy>=1.21.0 (numerical computations)
- pandas>=1.3.0 (data structures and analysis)
- matplotlib>=3.3.0 (visualization)
- scikit-learn>=1.0.0 (ML algorithms including PCA)
- jupyter>=1.0.0 (interactive notebooks)

Verified:
- All dependencies are compatible versions
- Requirements cover all planned functionality
