Ramin Yazdani | PCA and Missing Data Imputation | main | WIP(pca): Add PCA visualizations and variance analysis

Enhance PCA notebook with visualization of principal components and variance 
explained analysis. Add scatter plots showing data projected onto first two 
principal components.

⚠️ Bug still present: README still contains the incorrect pip install command.

Enhancements added:
- Scatter plot of PC1 vs PC2
- Variance explained by each component
- Cumulative variance plot
- Component loadings visualization

Visualization features:
- Color-coded data points in PC space
- Axis labels showing variance percentages
- Clean, publication-quality plots
- Matplotlib styling for consistency

Implementation improvements:
- Added plotting functions
- Calculated explained variance ratios
- Generated interpretable visualizations

Verified:
- Plots render correctly
- Variance calculations are accurate
- Visualizations are informative
