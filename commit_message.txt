Ramin Yazdani | PCA and Missing Data Imputation | main | feat(results): Generate and commit all analysis results

Run all three notebooks to generate the complete set of outputs including PCA 
scatter plots, imputation quality histograms, parameter sweep visualizations, 
and metric CSV files. These outputs demonstrate the analyses and provide 
reproducible results for portfolio presentation.

Contents added to code/results/:
- pca_scatter_pc1_pc2.png (PCA visualization)
- ctrl1_imputation_hist.png (distribution imputation quality)
- ctrl1_imputation_sweep.png (parameter sweep results)
- ctrl1_knn_imputation_hist.png (kNN imputation quality)
- ctrl1_metrics_distribution.csv (distribution method metrics)
- ctrl1_metrics_knn.csv (kNN method metrics)
- ctrl1_metrics_summary_min.csv (summary comparison)

Generated outputs demonstrate:
- PCA successfully reduces dimensionality while preserving variance
- All imputation methods handle missing data effectively
- kNN provides competitive performance vs. distribution methods
- Parameter choices significantly impact imputation quality
- Results are fully reproducible from the notebooks

Verified:
- All plots are high quality and publication-ready
- CSV files contain complete metrics for all methods
- Results match notebook calculations exactly
- All outputs are properly formatted
