Ramin Yazdani | PCA and Missing Data Imputation | main | WIP(docs): Fix pip install command in README

Correct the installation instruction in README - the pip install command was 
missing the `-r` flag, which would cause installation to fail. Changed from 
`pip install requirements.txt` to `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

🔧 HOTFIX: This fixes the bug introduced in steps 06-07.

Changes:
- README.md: Fixed pip command from `pip install requirements.txt` to 
  `pip install -r requirements.txt`

What was wrong:
- Without the `-r` flag, pip interprets "requirements.txt" as a package name
- This would fail with "ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement"
- Users would be unable to install dependencies

How fixed:
- Added the `-r` flag to correctly specify a requirements file
- Installation command now works as documented

Verified:
- Tested the corrected command in a clean virtual environment
- All dependencies install successfully without errors
